# Vendored icon assets — third-party attribution

The SVG files under `crypto/` and `flags/` are vendored from third-party
open-source projects. They are bundled here so the trading UI works in
air-gapped environments and is independent of any third-party CDN.

## crypto/ — cryptocurrency-icons

- **Upstream**: <https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons>
- **License**: CC0 1.0 Universal (public domain dedication)
- **Vendored subset**: a curated selection matching the assets the UI
  knows about today. Tokens not present here trigger the in-app
  textual-badge fallback (`RemoteSvg.tsx`).

CC0 places no restrictions on use. The notice here is courtesy
attribution — you may use, modify, and redistribute these files freely.

## flags/ — circle-flags

- **Upstream**: <https://github.com/HatScripts/circle-flags>
- **License**: MIT
- **Vendored subset**: the country codes referenced in
  `src/components/InstrumentIcon/registry/fiat.ts`.

The MIT license text required for redistribution is reproduced below.

## Updating the vendored subset

```sh
# Re-sync from upstream (requires git + curl):
pnpm icons:vendor
```

The script is `scripts/vendor-icons.sh`. It clones both upstream repos to
a temporary directory and copies the requested subset of SVGs. Run it
after adding new entries to `src/components/InstrumentIcon/registry/crypto.ts`
or `src/components/InstrumentIcon/registry/fiat.ts`.

Upstream license texts are reproduced manually in this file; if either
upstream changes its license, update the relevant section here as well.
